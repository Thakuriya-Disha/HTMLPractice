            <li>Classes are not unique. IDs are unique.</li>
            <li>There can be multiple classes. Where as there should be just one ID with the same value in a file.</li>
            <li>Classes are denoted with dot. IDs are denoted with hash.</li>

        <h3>III. What are self-closing tags?</h3>
        In HTML, the tags that do not require a closing tag to get terminated are known as self-closing tags.

        In HTML, there are 6 heading tags &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;. &lt;h1&gt; has the highest priority and &lt;h6&gt; has the least priority.<br>
        <strong>How and where are the different heading tags used?</strong> It depends on our requirements and are used when necessary. Though it is recommended &lt;h1&gt; should be used just once at the very beginning.
        <br>Example (below):<br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><h1>Hello I am h1. &nbsp</h1></td>
                <td><h2>Hello I am h2. &nbsp</h2></td>
                <td><h3>Hello I am h3. &nbsp</h3></td>
                <td><h4>Hello I am h4. &nbsp</h4></td>
                <td><h5>Hello I am h5. &nbsp</h5></td>
                <td><h6>Hello I am h6.</h6></td>
            </tr>
        </table><hr> 
        <h3>V. Block Elements vs Inline Elements</h3>
        <strong>Block: </strong>Their attributes such as height, width, size can be changed using CSS.<br>
        <strong>Inline: </strong>Their attributes such as height, width, size cannot be changed.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Block: </strong>They take up the whole width of the screen.<br>
        <strong>Inline: </strong>They take only the required space.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Block: </strong>Always starts from a new line.<br>
        <strong>Inline: </strong>Not necessary to start from a new line.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Block: </strong>Their examples are &lt;div&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;<br>
        <strong>Inline: </strong>Their examples are &lt;span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;
        <h3>VI. &lt;em&gt; Tag vs &lt;strong&gt; Tag</h3>
        The &lt;em&gt; & &lt;strong&gt; tags are preferred over &lt;i&gt; & &lt;b&gt; tags as they increase webpage's SEO Rankings.<br>
        <strong>strong</strong> tag is used to show the <u>importance</u> of a text by making it bold. <br>
        <em>em</em> tag is used to put <u>emphasis</u> on a text by italicizing it.
        <h3>VII. What are Attributes in HTML?</h3>
        <strong>Attributes</strong> give additional information about a tag. They enhance the properties of the tag.<br>
        They should always be written in lowercase alphabets. They must always be given in the opening tag.<br>
        Multiple attributes can be used in a particular tag and must be separated by space.<br>
        For example, Attributes used below: "color" and "align".
        <p style="color:blue" align="center">"Midnights" Taylor Swift's 10th studio album and her 4th Pop album is a Masterpiece!!!</p>

        <h3>VIII. HTML Tag vs HTML Element</h3>
        Tag consists of the opening and closing tags, or self-closing tags. <br>
        If we give content inside the tag, it becomes an element. <br>
        Example of only tag: &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Example of an element: &lt;h1&gt; Content &lt;/h1&gt;
        <br> Tag + Content = Element
